    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics, particularly concerning the statistical analysis of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and hierarchical Bayesian methods, a fundamental challenge arises. This challenge involves determining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gravitational wave signals across a vast number of events, potentially reaching millions. Such a task, with traditional computational approaches, is both time-intensive and impractical for in-depth analysis. The Python package `gwsnr` addresses this bottleneck by providing an efficient and precise methodology for calculating the SNR of gravitational wave signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of `gwsnr`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gwsnr` package leverages advanced techniques to enhance computational performance significantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Innovative Interpolation Method**: Utilizing a novel half-scaling approach, `gwsnr` interpolates the SNR for gravitational waves originating from spin-less binary systems. The interpolation is executed with respect to the mass parameters of the binary system, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Product Calculation with Multiprocessing**: In a manner akin to the SNR calculation approach in the `bilby` package, `gwsnr` employs a noise-weighted inner product method. This technique is adept at handling gravitational wave signals from spin-precessing binary systems. Unique to `gwsnr` is the integration of multiprocessing, which facilitates the parallel processing of complex computations, significantly speeding up the SNR calculation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Performance with Numba**: The package further optimizes performance by utilizing `numba`'s Just-In-Time (njit) compiler. This approach compiles Python code to machine code at runtime, significantly reducing execution time and enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "These advancements position `gwsnr` as a pivotal tool in gravitational wave data analysis, streamlining the process of SNR calculation in large-scale gravitational wave studies."

    "# Modified `FINDCHIRP` Method: Half Scaling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The Half Scaling method in `gwsnr` offers an efficient interpolation approach for determining the SNR of gravitational wave signals from spin-less binary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basis\n",
    "This method draws upon the analytical SNR formulation presented in [FINDCHIRP](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509116), originally intended for inspiral-only waveforms. However, the Half Scaling approach extends its applicability to encompass non-spinning IMR (inspiral-merger-ringdown) waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "1. **Identification and Interpolation of Critical Formula Components**: The most computationally intensive segment of the formula, denoted as 'halfsnr', is interpolated over a mass parameter grid (including mass ratio and total mass). This interpolation utilizes a refined 2D cubic spline technique, akin to `scipy`'s implementation. Pre-calculated spline coefficients are stored for efficient reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SNR Calculation**: For specific gravitational wave parameters, 'halfsnr' is computed using the pre-stored spline coefficients, and the remaining parts of the formula are evaluated analytically. All functions involved are optimized using `numba`'s Just-In-Time (njit) compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation**: The interpolation method's efficacy is verified through comparative analysis with `bilby`'s inner product method, demonstrating consistent results."
