Question: How to keep track of jupyter notebook files on git and avoid messy merge conflicts?
Answer: https://www.wrighters.io/version-control-for-jupyter-notebooks/
REMEMBER: install nbdime with `pip install nbdime`

Question: Should I develop the existing prototypes further?
Answer: No. The point of prototyping is that they are messy, can be worked on on the fly, with every prototype becoming incrementally better. They don't need to be maintained; instead, once a prototype is complete and works, add it to the core python code so that it becomes a part of the package. If you want to test something similar to what already exists as a prototype, just start a new prototype file and copy-paste.
