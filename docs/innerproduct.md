# Noise-Weighted Inner Product Method

The `gwsnr` package implements the standard noise-weighted inner product method to compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a core technique in gravitational-wave data analysis. This method is particularly suitable for frequency-domain waveforms generated by the [lalsimulation](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/lalsuite/lalsimulation.html) library, including complex models that incorporate spin precession and subdominant harmonic modes (e.g. IMRPhenomXHM).

To enhance computational performance, `gwsnr` parallelizes waveform generation across multiple CPU cores and uses `numba`'s Just-In-Time (`njit`) compilation to accelerate antenna response functions, chirptime (signal duration) calculation, and inner product calculations. Additionally, the package offers optional support for JAX-based acceleration through the [ripple](https://github.com/hemantaph/ripple) waveform library, using `jax.jit` for compilation and `jax.vmap` for batched operations.

## Mathematical Formulation

Following [@Allen:2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0509116), the noise-weighted inner product between two complex-valued frequency-domain waveforms, $\tilde{a}(f)$ and $\tilde{b}(f)$, defined as

$$
\begin{align}
\left< a | b \right> = 4 \int_{f_{\min}}^{f_{\max}} \frac{\tilde{a}(f), \tilde{b}^*(f)}{S_n(f)} , df \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

Here, $S_n(f)$ denotes the one-sided power spectral density (PSD) of the detector noise, and $[f_{\min}, f_{\max}]$ is the analysis frequency band.

### Optimal SNR 

GW waveform can be expressed as a combination of plus and cross polarizations, $\tilde{h}(f) = \tilde{h}_+(f) + i\, \tilde{h}_\times(f)$. Using this, we can write optimal SNR as:

$$
\begin{align}
\rho_{\rm opt} = \sqrt{ \left< h | h \right> } = \sqrt{ 4 \int_{f_{\min}}^{f_{\max}} \frac{\tilde{h}(f)\, \tilde{h}^*(f)}{S_n(f)} \, df } \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

Assuming that $\tilde{h}_+$ and $\tilde{h}_\times$ are orthogonal, which is a good approximation for most waveform models including precessing cases, the SNR can be written in terms of detector response functions, and it reads

$$
\begin{align}
\rho_{\rm opt} = \sqrt{ F_+^2 \left< \tilde{h}_+ | \tilde{h}_+ \right> + F_\times^2 \left< \tilde{h}_\times | \tilde{h}_\times \right> } \tag{3}
\end{align}
$$

The antenna pattern functions $F_+$ and $F_\times$ depend on the detector's orientation and the source's sky location ($\alpha$, $\delta$), inclination ($\iota$), polarization angle ($\psi$), and geocent time ($t_c$). The waveform polarizations $\tilde{h}_{+,\times}$ themselves depend on both intrinsic parameters (component masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and spins) and extrinsic parameters (luminosity distance $D_L$, inclination angle $\iota$, coalescence phase $\phi_c$, and $t_c$).


### Network Optimal SNR

The network optimal SNR combines the individual detector optimal SNRs to provide a single measure of detectability across the entire detector network. For a network of $n$ detectors, the network SNR is calculated as:

$$
\begin{align}
\rho_{\rm opt, net} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_{{\rm opt,} i}^2} \tag{4}
\end{align}
$$

where $\rho_i$ is the optimal SNR in the $i$-th detector. This quadrature sum assumes that the noise in different detectors is uncorrelated, which is a reasonable approximation for geographically separated gravitational-wave detectors.

---

Noise-Weighted Inner Product Method provides a flexible and robust framework for computing optimal SNRs using arbitrary frequency-domain waveform models and detector configurations. The bottleneck in this method is waveform generation, which is mitigated to some extent by parallelizing it across multiple CPU cores. The remaining computations are efficiently handled through `numba.njit` (with multithreaded `prange` loops) compilation and acceleration, making this approach more efficient than traditional Bilby SNR generation.
